Currently, MuxFM only supports using Anchor as a backend. Soon, you'll be able to self-publish your entire podcast.

1. Create an account on [Anchor](https://anchor.fm)
2. Use [MuxFM Glue](./glue/getting-started) to generate your self-hosted RSS feed and JSON API
3. Use [MuxFM Site](./glue/getting-started) to publish your static website
